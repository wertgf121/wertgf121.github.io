	<p class="center">EPISODE IV<br>A NEW HOPE FOR CAMA CONVERSION</p>
	
	<p>It is a time of great change at the Tarrant Appraisal District.</p>
	
	<p>The fearless PS2 has been entrusted with a critical mission:
to bring to life a legendary animation that will inspire the galaxy.</p>
	
	<p>Yet confusion stirs in the ranks — whispers of PS1 and PS2 clash,
a rivalry born of similar names but distinct destinies.</p>
	
	<p>In the shadows, SWO, the Jedi Master of APIs,
commands unseen forces to shape the flow of data.</p>
	
	<p>Allan, the conqueror of the elusive Transparency Stars,
charts the course through the vast, unseen realms of clarity.</p>
	
	<p>Don, the silent webmaster, weaves the web that holds the network together,
while Nathan and Blake stand as vigilant sentinels, guardians of security’s gate.</p>
	
	<p>Behind the scenes, Johnathan, the master architect,
constructs the digital foundations upon which all depends.</p>
	
	<p>Greg and Roby, twin engineers of the infrastructure fleet,
fortify the system against chaos and decay.</p>
	
	<p>Donna, Avery, and Tiffany G, cartographers of the GIS cosmos,
map the uncharted territories with precision and care.</p>
	
	<p>Tiffany H patrols the PC and network nebula,
ensuring seamless connection across the expanse.</p>
	
	<p>Robin, the guardian of quality,
ensures every mission meets its highest standard.</p>
	
	<p>High above it all, Brian leads the Information Systems forces,
with Michael by his side, ready to execute the grand design.</p>

	<p>As the countdown begins, the fate of CAMA hangs in the balance,
and the Tarrant Appraisal District prepares to embrace a new dawn...</p>
